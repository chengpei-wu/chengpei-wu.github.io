# About Me
Hi, My research interests include machine learning and graph representation learning. Recently, my work has primarily focused on unsupervised graph representation learning, including topics such as graph pre-training and graph contrastive learning. Previously, I explored deep learning methods for efficient and accurate robustness estimation in complex networks.

In addition, I am also interested in graph foundation models, generative modeling, and large language models.
