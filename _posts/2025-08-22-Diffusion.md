## 1. Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by reversing a diffusion process. 
The central concept behind diffusion models is to progressively corrupt data by adding noise over several steps, and then train a model to reverse this process, reconstructing the original data from pure noise.
